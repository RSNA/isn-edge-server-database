OK;

 I think there could be several things wrong; e.g. there is no "Create

Dbase" command in the RSNA script. I have found the safest thing to do

is export the dbase with the command line tool pg_dump like so

 

      1> pg_dump -U dbase_owner -C -f filename.sql dbase_name

 

Restore it with

 

      2> psql -U dbase_owner -f filename.sql dbase_name

 

The -C (Create) option in line 1 will create (or replace) the dbase if

it does not (or does) exist when we do line 2
